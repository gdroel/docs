ZeroSettle helps iOS developers keep more of what they earn. Instead of handing Apple 30% on every transaction, route eligible purchases through our web checkout and pay just **5% + 50¢**.

We handle everything — payment processing, tax compliance, refunds, and receipts. You stay focused on building your app.

```swift
import ZeroSettleIAP

// Configure once
ZeroSettleIAP.shared.configure(.init(publishableKey: "your_key"))

// Fetch your products
let products = try await ZeroSettleIAP.shared.fetchProducts(userId: user.id)

// Show the payment sheet
.zsPaymentSheet(isPresented: $showCheckout, product: product, userId: user.id) { result in
    // Done. That's it.
}
```
