ZeroSettle helps iOS developers keep more of what they earn. Instead of handing Apple 30% on every transaction, route eligible purchases through our web checkout and pay just **5% + 50¢**.

We handle everything — payment processing, tax compliance, refunds, and receipts. You stay focused on building your app.

<CodeGroup>

```swift SwiftUI
import ZeroSettleKit

// Configure once
ZeroSettle.shared.configure(.init(publishableKey: "your_key"))

// Fetch your product catalog
let catalog = try await ZeroSettle.shared.fetchProducts(userId: user.id)

// Show the payment sheet
.zsPaymentSheet(item: $selectedProduct, userId: user.id) { result in
    // Done. That's it.
}
```

```tsx React Native
import { ZSPaymentSheet } from 'react-native-zerosettle-kit';

// Configure once
ZeroSettle.configure({ publishableKey: 'your_key' });

// Fetch your product catalog
const catalog = await ZeroSettle.fetchProducts(user.id);

// Show the payment sheet
<ZSPaymentSheet
  product={selectedProduct}
  userId={user.id}
  onComplete={(result) => {
    // Done. That's it.
  }}
/>
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:zerosettle/zerosettle.dart';

// Configure once
await ZeroSettle.instance.configure(publishableKey: 'your_key');

// Fetch your product catalog
final catalog = await ZeroSettle.instance.fetchProducts(userId: user.id);

// Show the payment sheet
final txn = await ZeroSettle.instance.presentPaymentSheet(
    productId: product.id, userId: user.id);
// Done. That's it.
```

## How It Works

Replace Apple's 30% cut with our 5% + 50¢ fee. ZeroSettle acts as your Merchant of Record — we handle the entire payment flow, tax remittance, and compliance so you don't have to.

<Steps>
<Step title="User Taps Purchase">
  Your app shows a purchase button. When tapped, ZeroSettle presents a native payment sheet with Apple Pay and card support.
</Step>

<Step title="User Pays">
  The user completes payment without leaving your app. We support Apple Pay, credit cards, and debit cards.
</Step>

<Step title="You Get a Callback">
  Your app receives a verified `ZSTransaction` confirming the purchase.
</Step>

<Step title="You Deliver Content">
  Unlock the content. Entitlements are tracked automatically.
</Step>
</Steps>
