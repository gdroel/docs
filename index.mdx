ZeroSettle is a Merchant of Record platform that processes mobile app payments via web checkout. Instead of routing purchases through Apple or Google's in-app purchase systems, your app uses ZeroSettle's SDK to accept payments directly — with Apple Pay and card support.

The platform handles payment processing, tax compliance, refunds, and receipts. You integrate the SDK and handle purchase callbacks.

**Already on Stripe?** [Bring Your Own Stripe (BYOS)](/iap/stripe-catalog) lets you connect your existing Stripe account. Your products, prices, reporting, and customer relationships stay in your Stripe dashboard — ZeroSettle adds the MoR compliance layer on top.

```swift SwiftUI
import ZeroSettleKit

// Configure once
ZeroSettle.shared.configure(.init(publishableKey: "your_key"))

// Fetch your product catalog
let catalog = try await ZeroSettle.shared.fetchProducts(userId: user.id)

// Show the payment sheet
.zsPaymentSheet(item: $selectedProduct, userId: user.id) { result in
    // Done. That's it.
}
```

```kotlin Android
import com.zerosettle.sdk.ZeroSettle

// Configure once
ZeroSettle.configure(context, ZeroSettle.Configuration(
    publishableKey = "your_key"
))

// Fetch your product catalog
val catalog = ZeroSettle.bootstrap(userId = user.id)

// Show the payment sheet
val txn = ZeroSettle.purchase(activity, product.id, user.id)
// Done. That's it.
```

```tsx React Native
import { ZeroSettle } from 'react-native-zerosettle-kit';

// Configure once
await ZeroSettle.configure({ publishableKey: 'your_key' });

// Fetch your product catalog
const catalog = await ZeroSettle.fetchProducts(user.id);

// Show the payment sheet
const txn = await ZeroSettle.purchase(product.id, user.id);
// Done. That's it.
```

```dart Flutter
import 'package:zerosettle/zerosettle.dart';

// Configure once
await ZeroSettle.instance.configure(publishableKey: 'your_key');

// Fetch your product catalog
final catalog = await ZeroSettle.instance.fetchProducts(userId: user.id);

// Show the payment sheet
final txn = await ZeroSettle.instance.presentPaymentSheet(
    productId: product.id, userId: user.id);
// Done. That's it.
```

## How It Works

ZeroSettle acts as the Merchant of Record for your purchases — handling the payment flow, tax remittance, and compliance. The managed-mode fee is 5% + 50¢ per transaction.

  Your app shows a purchase button. When tapped, ZeroSettle presents a native payment sheet with Apple Pay and card support.
</Step>

<Step title="User Pays">
  The user completes payment without leaving your app. Apple Pay, credit cards, and debit cards are all supported.
</Step>

<Step title="You Get a Callback">
  Your app receives a verified `ZSTransaction` confirming the purchase.
</Step>

<Step title="You Deliver Content">
  Unlock the content. Entitlements are tracked automatically.
