description: "Subscription revenue platform for mobile apps"
---

ZeroSettle is a subscription revenue platform for mobile apps. It replaces Apple and Google's in-app purchase systems with web checkout — and goes beyond payments to handle the full subscription lifecycle: entitlements, retention, migration, and payouts.

ZeroSettle acts as the **Merchant of Record**, handling payment processing, tax compliance, refunds, receipts, and liability. You integrate the SDK and focus on your app.

**Already on Stripe?** [Bring Your Own Stripe (BYOS)](/iap/stripe-catalog) lets you connect your existing Stripe account. Your products, prices, and customer relationships stay in your dashboard — ZeroSettle adds the MoR layer on top.

## Fee Comparison

| | Apple/Google IAP | ZeroSettle (Managed) | ZeroSettle (BYOS) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Platform fee** | 30% (15% small business) | 5% + 50¢ | 0.5% |
| **You keep on a $9.99 sale** | ~$7.00 | ~$8.50 | ~$9.50 |
| **Tax handling** | Apple/Google handles | ZeroSettle handles | ZeroSettle handles |
| **Payouts** | 45+ days | Rolling via Stripe | Direct to your Stripe |

<Tip>
  See [Payouts](/iap/payouts) for a detailed fee breakdown and payout schedule.

## Payments

Process payments via Stripe instead of Apple's StoreKit or Google Play Billing. The SDK presents a native payment sheet with Apple Pay and card support — the user never leaves your app.
