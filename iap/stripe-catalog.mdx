Stripe Catalog lets you map your existing Stripe products and prices to the matching ZeroSettle products. This is used when your account is in **self-managed** (Bring Your Own Stripe) payment mode, so purchases are routed through your own Stripe account with the correct product and price IDs.

## Who Is This For?

Stripe Catalog is relevant if you use **BYOS (Bring Your Own Stripe)** mode — meaning you've connected your own standard Stripe account instead of using ZeroSettle's managed Stripe Express onboarding.

If you're using ZeroSettle's default Express setup, products and prices are created for you automatically and you can skip this page.

## How It Works

When a customer checks out, ZeroSettle creates a Stripe `PaymentIntent` (or `Subscription`) using the product and price IDs from your mapping. Without a mapping, ZeroSettle wouldn't know which Stripe product corresponds to which StoreKit product in your catalog.

The mapping ensures:

- **Correct line items** — the Stripe charge references the right product in your Stripe dashboard
- **Subscription sync** — recurring products are linked to the correct Stripe `Price` for billing
- **Revenue reporting** — Stripe's revenue reports match your ZeroSettle transaction history

## Mapping Products

1. Navigate to **Products** in your ZeroSettle dashboard
2. Open the **Stripe Catalog** tab
3. For each ZeroSettle product, select the corresponding Stripe product and price from the dropdown
4. Click **Save**

Each mapping links a ZeroSettle product (identified by its App Store product ID) to a Stripe `Product` and `Price` pair.

<Tip>
Make sure your Stripe prices use the same currency and amount as your ZeroSettle web prices. Mismatched prices will cause checkout errors.
</Tip>

## Requirements

To use Stripe Catalog, your account must meet these conditions:

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Payment mode** | Set to `self_managed` (BYOS) in your tenant settings |
| **Stripe account** | A standard Stripe account connected via OAuth (not Express) |
| **Products in Stripe** | At least one active product with a price in your Stripe dashboard |
| **Products in ZeroSettle** | At least one product created in the ZeroSettle dashboard |

<Note>
If you switch from BYOS back to ZeroSettle-managed payments, your Stripe Catalog mappings are preserved but not used — ZeroSettle will create and manage products automatically.
</Note>

## Auto-Mapping

When you connect your Stripe account, ZeroSettle can automatically suggest mappings between your Stripe products and ZeroSettle products based on name and price similarity. Auto-mapped products are labeled **"AI match"** in the dashboard.

Review auto-mapped products before saving — especially for apps with multiple subscription tiers (e.g., monthly and yearly) that share similar names. You can override any mapping manually.

## SDK Integration

BYOS mode requires no code changes. The same SDK calls (`purchase()`, `fetchProducts()`, `restoreEntitlements()`) work identically whether you're on Managed or BYOS — the backend handles routing to the correct Stripe account and price automatically.
