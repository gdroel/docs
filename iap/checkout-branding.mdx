The Checkout Branding tab in your [ZeroSettle dashboard](https://dashboard.zerosettle.io) lets you customize the look of the payment sheet so it feels like a natural part of your app. Changes apply immediately — no app update required.

## Logo & App Icon

Upload your app's logo and icon from the **Checkout > Branding** tab. These appear in the checkout header above the payment options.

| Asset | Recommended Size | Format | Where It Appears |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Logo** | 512×512 px | PNG or JPEG | Checkout header, centered above product info |
| **App Icon** | 256×256 px | PNG or JPEG | Compact checkout layouts, next to your app name |

<Tip>
Use a transparent-background PNG for your logo so it looks clean against both light and dark checkout themes.
</Tip>

## Brand Colors

Set your **primary brand color** using the color picker in the Branding tab. This color is applied to:

- **Pay button** — background fill
- **Apple Pay button** — tint accent (where supported)
- **Links and highlights** — interactive elements in the checkout

The color you set here is served to the SDK as part of the checkout configuration. No code change is needed.

## Preview

After saving your branding changes, you can preview the checkout in sandbox mode:

1. Set your app to use your **sandbox** publishable key (`zs_pk_test_...`)
2. Trigger a purchase — the payment sheet will render with your updated branding
3. Use Stripe's [test card numbers](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards) to complete the flow without a real charge

<Note>
Branding changes take effect on the next `fetchProducts()` call. If you're testing, restart your app or re-fetch products to pick up updates.
</Note>

## How It Works

The SDK fetches your branding configuration automatically as part of `fetchProducts()`. The checkout HTML is rendered server-side with your logo, icon, and primary color injected — no client-side setup is needed.

```swift
// No branding code required — the SDK handles it.
let catalog = try await ZeroSettle.shared.fetchProducts(userId: user.id)

// When the payment sheet is presented, your branding is already applied.
```

If no branding is configured, the checkout uses ZeroSettle's default styling.
