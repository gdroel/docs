The cancel flow is a multi-step UI that intercepts cancellation requests. It collects feedback via a questionnaire, optionally presents a retention offer or pause option, and processes the outcome. The entire flow is configured from the [ZeroSettle dashboard](https://dashboard.zerosettle.io) — update questions and offers without an app update.

## Configuring Questions

Add, edit, and reorder questions from the dashboard. Each question has:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Question text** | The prompt shown to the user (max 500 characters) |
| **Question type** | `single_select` (predefined options) or `free_text` (open response) |
| **Required** | Whether the user must answer before proceeding |
| **Options** | For `single_select` only — an ordered list of options, each with a label |

Questions are presented in the order you set on the dashboard. Drag to reorder.

## Retention Offers

Enable or disable the save offer from the dashboard. When enabled, the flow can present a retention offer before processing the cancellation.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Offer title** | Heading shown on the offer page (max 200 characters) |
| **Offer body** | Explanation of the offer |
| **CTA text** | Button text for accepting the offer (max 100 characters) |
| **Offer type** | `discount_percent` (e.g., 20% off), `free_period` (e.g., 1 month free), or `custom` |
| **Offer value** | Numeric value (e.g., `20` for 20% off, `30` for 30 days free) |

When a user accepts the retention offer, the outcome is recorded as `retained` and the subscription continues with the applied offer.

## Pause Option

Enable or disable pause as an alternative to cancellation. When enabled, the flow can present a pause page where the user picks a duration.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pause title** | Heading shown on the pause page |
| **Pause body** | Explanation of what pausing means |
| **Pause CTA text** | Button text for confirming the pause |
| **Pause duration options** | Each option has a label and either a number of days or a specific resume date |

When a user pauses:

- The entitlement status changes to `paused` with a `pauseResumesAt` date
- Access is revoked during the pause period
- The subscription resumes automatically on the resume date and access is restored

## Answer-Level Triggers

Individual answer options in a `single_select` question can trigger specific pages in the flow:

| Trigger | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `triggers_offer: true` | Routes the user to the retention offer page after answering |
| `triggers_pause: true` | Routes the user to the pause page after answering |

Only one trigger can be set per option. Options without triggers proceed to the next question or the default flow.

This lets you tailor the experience based on the cancellation reason. For example, if a user selects "Too expensive," route them to a discount offer. If they select "Taking a break," route them to the pause page.

## Outcomes

Every cancel flow interaction results in one of four outcomes:

| Outcome | Description |
|---|---|
| `cancelled` | User completed the flow and cancelled their subscription |
| `retained` | User accepted the retention offer and kept their subscription |
| `paused` | User chose to pause their subscription |
| `dismissed` | User closed the flow without completing it |

## Analytics

The dashboard tracks detailed analytics per cancel flow response:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Outcome distribution** | Breakdown of cancelled, retained, paused, and dismissed outcomes |
| **Offer shown / accepted** | Whether the retention offer was presented and whether the user accepted |
| **Pause shown / accepted** | Whether the pause option was presented and whether the user accepted |
| **Pause duration selected** | Which pause duration the user chose |
| **Last step reached** | The furthest step the user reached in the flow |
| **Question answers** | Individual responses — selected option label or free text content |

Use this data to optimize your questions and offers. For example, if most users who see the retention offer accept it, consider triggering it for more answer options. If a particular question has low completion, simplify it.

<Tip>
  Update questions, offers, and triggers from the dashboard at any time. Changes take effect immediately — no app update required.
