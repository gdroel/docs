ZeroSettle collects payments as Merchant of Record and pays out revenue to you via Stripe Connect. How payouts work depends on your payment mode.

## Managed Mode

In Managed mode, ZeroSettle processes the charge on your behalf using a Stripe Express account.

1. Customer pays via web checkout
2. ZeroSettle collects the payment, deducts platform and processing fees
3. Net revenue is transferred to your Stripe Express account
4. Stripe pays out to your linked bank account on the standard payout schedule

Access your Express dashboard directly from the [ZeroSettle dashboard](https://dashboard.zerosettle.io) to view transfers and update your bank details.

## BYOS Mode

In Bring Your Own Stripe mode, charges go directly to your Stripe account. ZeroSettle collects a 0.5% application fee on each transaction.

You retain full control of your Stripe dashboard, reporting, payout schedule, and customer management. ZeroSettle handles sales tax collection and remittance as MoR regardless of mode.

## Fee Breakdown

| | Managed | BYOS |
|---|---|---|
| **Stripe processing** | ~2.9% + 30c | ~2.9% + 30c (your negotiated rate) |
| **ZeroSettle platform fee** | 5% + 50c | 0.5% |
| **Sales tax** | Collected & remitted by ZeroSettle | Collected & remitted by ZeroSettle |
| **Net to you** | Gross - Stripe - ZeroSettle fees | Gross - Stripe - 0.5% |

### Example: $9.99 Sale

**Managed mode:**

| Line item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Gross | $9.99 |
| Stripe processing (2.9% + 30c) | -$0.59 |
| ZeroSettle platform fee (5% + 50c) | -$1.00 |
| **Net to you** | **$8.40** |

**BYOS mode:**

| Line item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Gross | $9.99 |
| Stripe processing (2.9% + 30c) | -$0.59 |
| ZeroSettle application fee (0.5%) | -$0.05 |
| **Net to you** | **$9.35** |

<Note>
  Sales tax is collected from the customer on top of the product price and remitted by ZeroSettle. It does not reduce your net revenue.

## Viewing Payout History

The dashboard payouts page shows a history of all payouts with:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Amount** | Payout amount in your currency |
| **Currency** | Payout currency (e.g., USD) |
| **Status** | `paid`, `pending`, `in_transit`, or `failed` |
| **Arrival date** | Expected or actual arrival date |
| **Destination** | Last 4 digits of the destination bank account |

The status endpoint returns your current balance (available and pending) along with your payout schedule details (interval and delay days).

## Payout Schedule

Payout timing is controlled by Stripe. The default for US accounts is a rolling 2-day schedule — funds from a charge become available 2 business days after the payment is captured.

You can view your schedule details on the dashboard. To change your payout schedule or frequency, update it from your Stripe Express dashboard (Managed) or your Stripe dashboard (BYOS).

## Tax Handling

ZeroSettle handles sales tax as Merchant of Record:

- **Tax is collected from the customer** — added on top of the product price at checkout
- **Tax is remitted to authorities** — ZeroSettle files and pays sales tax in all applicable US jurisdictions
- **You receive net revenue after fees** — tax never touches your payout
- **No 1099 headaches for end customers** — ZeroSettle is the seller of record

<Tip>
  Because ZeroSettle is the Merchant of Record, your customers receive receipts from ZeroSettle. You receive payouts as a platform partner, not as a direct seller.
