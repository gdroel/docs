Work through each section before switching from sandbox to live.

## Dashboard Checklist

- [ ] Stripe live onboarding complete (Managed: Express details submitted; BYOS: Standard account connected and authorized)
- [ ] Live publishable key generated (`zs_pk_live_...`)
- [ ] Products created with correct web prices
- [ ] Checkout branding configured (logo, app icon, brand colors)
- [ ] Checkout type set per jurisdiction (`webview` recommended for US)
- [ ] Web checkout enabled for target jurisdictions

## Code Checklist

- [ ] Using live publishable key (not `zs_pk_test_`)
- [ ] Universal link handler configured (required for Safari checkout flow)
- [ ] `restoreEntitlements()` called on app launch (or via `bootstrap()`)
- [ ] Purchase error handling implemented in delegate
- [ ] Entitlement delegate callback updating UI (`zeroSettleEntitlementsDidUpdate`)
- [ ] Fallback to StoreKit / Play Billing when `isWebCheckoutEnabled` is `false`

<CodeGroup>
```swift Swift
// Verify your live configuration
ZeroSettle.shared.configure(.init(
    publishableKey: "zs_pk_live_..."  // Live key
))

// Verify fallback logic
if ZeroSettle.shared.isWebCheckoutEnabled {
    // Show web checkout
} else {
    // Fall back to StoreKit
}
```

```kotlin Kotlin
// Verify your live configuration
ZeroSettle.configure(context, ZeroSettle.Configuration(
    publishableKey = "zs_pk_live_..."  // Live key
))

// Verify fallback logic
if (ZeroSettle.isWebCheckoutEnabled) {
    // Show web checkout
} else {
    // Fall back to Play Billing
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## App Store / Play Store Checklist

- [ ] External Purchase Link entitlement approved by Apple (required for US)
- [ ] Disclosure modal implemented (Apple requires showing a modal before link-out in Safari flows)
- [ ] Google Play alternative billing option configured
- [ ] App review submitted with external purchase flow documented

<Warning>
  Apple requires the External Purchase Link entitlement for US apps that link out to web checkout via Safari. Apps without this entitlement may be rejected during review. The payment sheet (`webview`) flow does not require this entitlement.
</Warning>

<Note>
  The disclosure modal is only required for the Safari checkout flow. If you're using the payment sheet (`webview`) exclusively, you can skip this step.
</Note>

## Final Testing

- [ ] Full purchase tested end-to-end in sandbox with a test card
- [ ] Tested on a physical device (not just simulator)
- [ ] Tested restore on a fresh install / new device
- [ ] Tested cancel and refund flows
- [ ] Tested with web checkout disabled (StoreKit / Play Billing fallback works correctly)

<Tip>
  See [Testing & Sandbox](/iap/testing) for the full end-to-end test flow and test card numbers.
</Tip>

## Going Live

Once all checklists are complete:

1. **Switch your key** — replace `zs_pk_test_...` with `zs_pk_live_...` in your app configuration
2. **Deploy your update** — ship the app update through the App Store or Play Store
3. **Verify your first transaction** — make a real purchase and confirm it appears in the dashboard under live mode
4. **Monitor** — watch the dashboard for transaction volume, errors, and webhook delivery

<Note>
  The key prefix is the only thing that changes between sandbox and live. No other code changes are needed.
</Note>
