ZeroSettle makes it easy to determine subscription status with the ZeroSettleKit SDK and REST API.

## Getting subscription status via the SDK

The `entitlements` property contains all of the purchase and subscription data available about a user. This is updated whenever a purchase completes or when you call `restoreEntitlements()`.

<CodeGroup>

```swift Swift
// Restore and get current entitlements
let entitlements = try await ZeroSettle.shared.restoreEntitlements(
    userId: currentUser.id
)

// Or access cached entitlements
let cached = ZeroSettle.shared.entitlements
```

```kotlin Kotlin
// Restore and get current entitlements
val entitlements = ZeroSettle.restoreEntitlements(userId = currentUser.id)

// Or access cached entitlements
val cached = ZeroSettle.entitlements.value
```

</CodeGroup>

It's safe to call `restoreEntitlements()` frequently throughout your app. The SDK caches entitlements locally and the network request is lightweight.

## Checking If A User Is Subscribed

The subscription status for a user can be determined using the `Entitlement` objects returned by `restoreEntitlements()`.

For most apps with a single premium tier, check for a specific product:

<CodeGroup>

```swift Swift
let hasPremium = entitlements.contains {
    $0.productId == "premium_monthly" && $0.isActive
}

if hasPremium {
    // user has access to premium features
}
```

```kotlin Kotlin
val hasPremium = entitlements.any {
    it.productId == "premium_monthly" && it.isActive
}

if (hasPremium) {
    // user has access to premium features
}
```

</CodeGroup>

If your app has multiple entitlements, check if any are active:

<CodeGroup>

```swift Swift
if entitlements.contains(where: { $0.isActive }) {
    // user has access to some entitlement
}
```

```kotlin Kotlin
if (entitlements.any { it.isActive }) {
    // user has access to some entitlement
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Entitlements will be empty if no purchases have been made. Always handle the empty case in your UI.
</Note>

## Restoring Purchases

Restoring purchases allows users to recover their in-app purchases on a new device or after reinstalling the app.

It is recommended that all apps have a way for users to trigger restore, even if you require accounts.

```swift
do {
    let entitlements = try await ZeroSettle.shared.restoreEntitlements(
        userId: currentUser.id
    )
    // Update UI based on entitlements
    updatePremiumAccess(entitlements)
} catch {
    // handle error
}
```

This fetches entitlements from both ZeroSettle's web checkout system and StoreKit (if `syncStoreKitTransactions` is enabled).

## Cache

The SDK caches the user's subscription information to reduce your app's reliance on the network.

Users who unlock entitlements will be able to access them even without an internet connection. The SDK will update the cache if it's older than 5 minutes when you call `restoreEntitlements()`, make a purchase, or restore purchases. It's a good idea to call `restoreEntitlements()` any time a user accesses premium content.

## Listening For Entitlement Updates

Entitlements can change from various sources: web checkout completion, StoreKit/Play Store transaction updates, or subscription renewals/cancellations. Use the delegate to respond to changes:

<CodeGroup>

```swift Swift
class PurchaseManager: ZeroSettleDelegate {
    init() {
        ZeroSettle.shared.delegate = self
    }

    func zeroSettleEntitlementsDidUpdate(_ entitlements: [Entitlement]) {
        // Handle any changes to entitlements
        updatePremiumUI(entitlements)
    }
}
```

```kotlin Kotlin
class PurchaseManager : ZeroSettleDelegate {
    init {
        ZeroSettle.delegate = this
    }

    override fun zeroSettleEntitlementsDidUpdate(entitlements: List<Entitlement>) {
        // Handle any changes to entitlements
        updatePremiumUI(entitlements)
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

You can also observe state reactively in your UI framework:

<CodeGroup>

```swift SwiftUI
struct ContentView: View {
    @ObservedObject var iap = ZeroSettle.shared

    var body: some View {
        if iap.entitlements.contains(where: { $0.isActive }) {
            PremiumContent()
        } else {
            UpgradePrompt()
        }
    }
}
```

```kotlin Jetpack Compose
@Composable
fun ContentScreen() {
    val entitlements by ZeroSettle.entitlements.collectAsState()

    if (entitlements.any { it.isActive }) {
        PremiumContent()
    } else {
        UpgradePrompt()
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Entitlement updates are triggered by SDK operations (purchases, restores). They are not pushed from the backend in real-time.
</Note>

## Getting subscription status via the REST API

If you need to get a user's subscription status from outside of the ZeroSettle SDK, for example, from your own backend, you should use the REST API.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.zerosettle.io/v1/iap/entitlements?user_id=app_user_id \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-ZeroSettle-Key: your_secret_key'
```

## Handling Refunds

ZeroSettle handles refunds for both subscription and non-subscription products. As soon as a refund is processed, the entitlements will be updated to reflect the correct status — no action required on your part. The `isActive` property on the affected `Entitlement` will be set to `false`.
