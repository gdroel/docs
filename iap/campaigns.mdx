ZeroSettle provides three campaign types to grow and retain subscribers. All are configured from the [ZeroSettle dashboard](https://dashboard.zerosettle.io) with built-in analytics — no app update required to change targeting, messaging, or pricing.

## Migration Campaigns (Switch & Save)

Migration campaigns help you move existing StoreKit or Play Store subscribers to web checkout at a discount. This eliminates platform fees on future renewals while giving users a lower price.

### Configuration

Enable migration campaigns on the dashboard and configure:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Product ID** | The web checkout product to offer |
| **Discount %** | Percentage off the web price (0-100%) |
| **Min subscription days** | Minimum days subscribed before eligibility (default 30) |
| **Rollout %** | Percentage of eligible users who see the campaign (0-100%, for gradual rollout) |
| **Eligible product IDs** | Which store product IDs qualify for migration |
| **Title** | Campaign heading — supports `{{discount}}` template variable |
| **Message** | Campaign body text — supports `{{discount}}` template variable |
| **CTA text** | Button text — supports `{{discount}}` template variable |

### SDK Integration

The SDK returns campaign data in `ProductCatalog.config.migration`. Use the built-in `ZSMigrateTipView` for a drop-in UI, or read the data to build your own:

<CodeGroup>
```swift Swift
let catalog = try await ZeroSettle.shared.fetchProducts(userId: user.id)

if let migration = catalog.config?.migration {
    // Show migration prompt to eligible users
    print("\(migration.title): \(migration.discountPercent)% off")
}
```

```kotlin Kotlin
val catalog = ZeroSettle.fetchProducts(userId = user.id)

catalog.config?.migration?.let { migration ->
    // Show migration prompt to eligible users
    println("${migration.title}: ${migration.discountPercent}% off")
}
```

```tsx React Native
const catalog = await ZeroSettle.fetchProducts(user.id);

if (catalog.config?.migration) {
    const migration = catalog.config.migration;
    console.log(`${migration.title}: ${migration.discountPercent}% off`);
}
```

```dart Flutter
final catalog = await ZeroSettle.instance.fetchProducts(userId: user.id);

final migration = catalog.config?.migration;
if (migration != null) {
    print('${migration.title}: ${migration.discountPercent}% off');
}
```
</CodeGroup>

After a successful migration purchase, track the conversion:

<CodeGroup>
```swift Swift
try await ZeroSettle.shared.trackMigrationConversion(userId: user.id)
```

```kotlin Kotlin
ZeroSettle.trackMigrationConversion(userId = user.id)
```

```tsx React Native
await ZeroSettle.trackMigrationConversion(user.id);
```

```dart Flutter
await ZeroSettle.instance.trackMigrationConversion(userId: user.id);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Analytics

The dashboard tracks migration campaign performance:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Impressions** | Number of times the campaign was shown |
| **Conversions** | Number of users who completed the migration |
| **Conversion rate** | Conversions / impressions |

## Upgrade Offers

Upgrade offers prompt subscribers to switch from shorter billing cycles (e.g., monthly) to longer ones (e.g., annual) at a savings. The SDK handles proration for web checkout subscribers and shows Apple cancel instructions for StoreKit-to-web migrations.

### Configuration

Enable upgrade offers on the dashboard and configure:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Upgrade paths** | List of `from_product_id` to `to_product_id` mappings |
| **Eligible product IDs** | Which products qualify for upgrade offers |
| **Min subscription days** | Minimum days subscribed before eligibility (default 0) |
| **Title** | Offer heading — supports `{savings_percent}` and `{target_name}` template variables |
| **Body** | Offer body text — supports `{savings_percent}` and `{target_name}` template variables |
| **CTA text** | Accept button text |
| **Dismiss text** | Decline button text |
| **StoreKit body** | Separate body text for users migrating from Apple billing |
| **StoreKit cancel instructions** | Instructions shown to Apple subscribers for cancelling their App Store subscription |

### SDK Integration

Present the upgrade offer using a SwiftUI modifier or the programmatic API:

<CodeGroup>
```swift Swift
@State private var showUpgradeOffer = false

Button("See Upgrade Options") {
    showUpgradeOffer = true
}
.upgradeOffer(
    isPresented: $showUpgradeOffer,
    productId: "premium_monthly",
    userId: currentUser.id
) { result in
    switch result {
    case .upgraded:
        showConfirmation("You've been upgraded!")
    case .declined, .dismissed:
        break
    }
}
```

```kotlin Kotlin
scope.launch {
    val result = ZeroSettle.presentUpgradeOffer(
        activity = context as Activity,
        productId = "premium_monthly",
        userId = currentUser.id,
    )
    when (result) {
        UpgradeOfferResult.Upgraded -> showConfirmation("You've been upgraded!")
        UpgradeOfferResult.Declined -> { /* No action */ }
        UpgradeOfferResult.Dismissed -> { /* No action */ }
    }
}
```

```dart Flutter
final result = await ZeroSettle.instance.presentUpgradeOffer(
  productId: 'premium_monthly',
  userId: currentUser.id,
);
switch (result) {
  case UpgradeOfferUpgraded():
    showConfirmation("You've been upgraded!");
  case UpgradeOfferDeclined():
  case UpgradeOfferDismissed():
    break;
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Analytics

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Impressions** | Number of times the upgrade offer was shown |
| **Upgrades completed** | Number of users who accepted the upgrade |
| **Conversion rate** | Upgrades / impressions |

## Promotions

Promotional pricing lets you offer discounts on any product. Promotions are configured per-product on the dashboard and surfaced automatically in the SDK product data.

### Configuration

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Display name** | Label shown to users (e.g., "Launch Sale") |
| **Type** | `percent_off`, `fixed_amount`, or `free_trial` |
| **Promotional price** | The discounted price during the promotion |
| **Expiration** | Optional expiry date — no expiration means the promotion runs indefinitely |

### Accessing Promotions

Active promotions are returned alongside product data. No separate fetch is needed:

<CodeGroup>
```swift Swift
if let promo = product.promotion {
    print("\(promo.displayName): \(promo.promotionalPrice.formatted)")
}
```

```kotlin Kotlin
product.promotion?.let { promo ->
    println("${promo.displayName}: ${promo.promotionalPrice?.formatted}")
}
```

```tsx React Native
if (product.promotion) {
    const promo = product.promotion;
    console.log(`${promo.displayName}: ${promo.promotionalPrice.formatted}`);
}
```

```dart Flutter
final promo = product.promotion;
if (promo != null) {
    print('${promo.displayName}: ${promo.promotionalPrice.formatted}');
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Promotions surface automatically in SDK product data. Create, update, or end promotions from the dashboard at any time — no code change required.
