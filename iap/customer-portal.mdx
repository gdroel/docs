ZeroSettle provides a customer portal powered by Stripe where your customers can manage their subscriptions and payment methods.

## Accessing the Portal

Customers can access their portal through links included in emails that ZeroSettle sends automatically:

- **Subscription confirmation** emails
- **Renewal receipt** emails
- **Billing issue** notifications

Each email contains a "Manage Subscription" link that opens the Stripe-powered billing portal.

## What Customers Can Do

In the customer portal, customers can:

- **See upcoming payment information** — View details about their next billing cycle
- **Cancel a subscription** — End their subscription with immediate effect or at period end
- **Change subscription products** — Upgrade or downgrade to different subscription tiers
- **Re-subscribe** — Reactivate a cancelled subscription before it expires
- **Update payment methods** — Change or add new payment methods
- **View payment history** — See a complete list of all past payments
- **Download receipts and invoices** — Get PDF receipts and invoices for their records

## Entitlement Updates

All changes made in the customer portal are automatically reflected in your app. When a customer cancels or changes their subscription through the portal, the entitlements returned by `restoreEntitlements()` will reflect the updated status on the next call.

```swift
// Entitlements stay in sync automatically
let entitlements = try await ZeroSettleIAP.shared.restoreEntitlements(
    userId: currentUser.id
)

// Check if the user still has access
let hasAccess = entitlements.contains { $0.isActive }
```
