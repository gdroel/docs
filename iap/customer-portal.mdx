ZeroSettle comes with a no-code customer portal for customers to manage their own subscriptions.

## Accessing the customer portal

Each email (subscription confirmation, renewal, billing issue) that ZeroSettle sends to customers contains a link for the customer to access their customer portal. You can also programmatically generate a portal link for your users:

```swift
do {
    let portalURL = try await ZeroSettle.shared.getManagementURL(userId: currentUser.id)
    if let url = portalURL {
        // Open management portal
        UIApplication.shared.open(url)
    }
} catch {
    print("Failed to get management URL: \(error)")
}
```

## Managing subscriptions through the customer portal

In the customer portal, customers can:

- **See upcoming payment information** - View details about their next billing cycle
- **Cancel a subscription** - End their subscription with immediate effect or at period end
- **Change subscription products** - Upgrade or downgrade to different subscription tiers
- **Re-subscribe** - Reactivate a cancelled subscription before it expires
- **Update payment methods** - Change or add new payment methods
- **View payment history** - See a complete list of all past payments
- **Download receipts and invoices** - Get PDF receipts and invoices for their records

All changes made in the customer portal are automatically synchronized with your app, and the `CustomerInfo` will be updated accordingly.
