## Create Your Account

Sign up at [dashboard.zerosettle.io](https://dashboard.zerosettle.io) and create a workspace. Each workspace represents one organization and can contain multiple apps.

After signing up, you'll be guided through onboarding: connecting Stripe, adding your first app, and creating your first product.

## Connect Stripe

ZeroSettle supports two Stripe integration modes. Choose one during onboarding:

### Managed (Express)

One-click onboarding via Stripe Express. ZeroSettle creates and manages Stripe products and prices automatically. Payouts go directly to your bank account.

- **Fee:** 5% + 50¢ per transaction
- **Setup:** Enter your business details in the Stripe Express flow
- **Best for:** New apps, fast setup, no existing Stripe account

### Bring Your Own Stripe (BYOS)

Connect your existing Stripe standard account via OAuth. Keep your products, prices, and customers. Retain full access to the Stripe dashboard for reporting and analytics.

- **Fee:** 0.5% per transaction
- **Setup:** Authorize via OAuth, then map products in the [Stripe Catalog](/iap/stripe-catalog)
- **Best for:** Apps with an existing Stripe integration

### Comparison

| | Managed (Express) | BYOS |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup time** | Minutes | 15–30 minutes |
| **ZeroSettle fee** | 5% + 50¢ | 0.5% |
| **Stripe product management** | Automatic | You manage via Stripe dashboard |
| **Existing Stripe account required** | No | Yes |
| **Full Stripe dashboard access** | No | Yes |
| **Stripe Catalog mapping** | Not needed | Required |

<Tip>
  Start with **Managed** to get up and running quickly. You can switch to BYOS at any time from your tenant settings — existing Stripe Catalog mappings are preserved.
</Tip>

## Add Your App

After connecting Stripe, add the app that will use ZeroSettle. There are two paths:

### Option A: Connect App Store Connect

Upload your App Store Connect API key to automatically sync your apps and products.

1. In the dashboard, go to **Settings > App Store Connect**
2. Upload your `.p8` key file
3. Enter the **Key ID** and **Issuer ID** (found in App Store Connect under Users and Access > Integrations > App Store Connect API)
4. The dashboard validates your credentials and syncs your apps automatically

<Tip>
  Connecting App Store Connect enables automatic product sync and StoreKit price fetching. This is the recommended path if you have existing App Store products.
</Tip>

### Option B: Create Manually

If you don't have an App Store Connect key or prefer manual setup:

1. Go to **Apps** in the dashboard
2. Click **Add App**
3. Enter your app name and bundle ID (e.g., `com.yourcompany.yourapp`)

## Create Products

Add your first product from the dashboard. Each product requires:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Product ID** | Must match your App Store Connect product identifier (e.g., `com.app.premium_monthly`) |
| **Display name** | Shown to users in the checkout UI |
| **Description** | Product description |
| **Type** | Auto-renewable subscription, non-renewing subscription, consumable, or non-consumable |
| **Web price** | The price charged via web checkout |

For subscriptions, you'll also configure:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Subscription group** | Groups mutually exclusive subscription tiers (e.g., "Premium") |
| **Duration** | Billing interval — weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual |

<Note>
  If you connected App Store Connect, you can sync products directly from your ASC catalog. The dashboard will pre-fill product details and keep them in sync.
</Note>

## Your API Keys

The dashboard provides publishable keys for sandbox and live environments:

| Key | Prefix | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Sandbox** | `zs_pk_test_` | No real charges. Use during development. |
| **Live** | `zs_pk_live_` | Real payments processed via Stripe. |

The key prefix determines sandbox vs live mode — there is no separate environment toggle.

All ZeroSettle API endpoints — both the SDK and REST API — authenticate with your publishable key via the `X-ZeroSettle-Key` header.

Pass your publishable key to the SDK at launch:

<CodeGroup>
```swift Swift
ZeroSettle.shared.configure(.init(
    publishableKey: "zs_pk_test_..."  // Sandbox for development
))
```

```kotlin Kotlin
ZeroSettle.configure(context, ZeroSettle.Configuration(
    publishableKey = "zs_pk_test_..."  // Sandbox for development
))
```

```tsx React Native
await ZeroSettle.configure({
    publishableKey: 'zs_pk_test_...',  // Sandbox for development
});
```

```dart Flutter
await ZeroSettle.instance.configure(
    publishableKey: 'zs_pk_test_...',  // Sandbox for development
);
```
</CodeGroup>
