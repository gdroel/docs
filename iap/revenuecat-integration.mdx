## Overview

ZeroSettle provides native support for RevenueCat's paywall infrastructure, enabling developers to integrate payment incentives directly into their existing subscription flows. The integration is designed to be minimally invasive, requiring only a single component addition to your existing `PaywallView` implementation.

## Implementation

The integration architecture leverages SwiftUI's declarative layout system. Simply wrap your existing `PaywallView` component within a `ZStack` and add the `ZSCheckoutButton` component positioned at the bottom:

```swift
import RevenueCat
import ZeroSettle

ZStack() {
    PaywallView()
    ZSCheckoutButton()
}
```

## Technical Details

The `ZSCheckoutButton` component integrates directly with RevenueCat's SDK and ZeroSettle's backend infrastructure to provide the following functionality:

The button automatically detects and retrieves the currently selected subscription package from RevenueCat's `PaywallView`, eliminating the need for manual package state management or prop passing.

## Cancellation via Customer Portal

Direct users to the customer portal to manage their subscription:

```swift
import ZeroSettle

Button("Manage Subscription") {
    Task {
        do {
            let url = try await ZeroSettle.shared.getManagementURL(userId: currentUser.id)
            if let url = url {
                // Open management portal
                UIApplication.shared.open(url)
            }
        } catch {
            print("Failed to get management URL: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

The management portal allows users to:
- Cancel their subscription
- Update payment methods
- View billing history
- Reactivate cancelled subscriptions

All cancellation events are automatically synchronized between ZeroSettle and RevenueCat, ensuring consistent state across both platforms.

- RevenueCat SDK 4.0+
