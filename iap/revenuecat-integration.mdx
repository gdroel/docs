## Overview

ZeroSettle integrates with RevenueCat's paywall system through a simple checkout flow. No SDK integration or Swift code changes are required—simply add a custom checkout button to your paywall that directs users to the ZeroSettle payment screen.

## Implementation

To enable ZeroSettle checkout in your RevenueCat paywall, add a purchase button with the "custom checkout" option that links to:

```
https://zerosettle.io/checkout
```

That's it! When users tap this button, they'll be directed to a payment screen with the discount you configured in your ZeroSettle dashboard already applied.

## How It Works

1. **Configure Your Discount**: Set up your payment incentive discount in the ZeroSettle dashboard
2. **Add Custom Checkout Button**: In your RevenueCat paywall, add a purchase button with custom checkout enabled
3. **Link to ZeroSettle**: Point the button to `https://zerosettle.io/checkout`
4. **Automatic Discount Application**: Users will see the discounted price automatically applied based on your dashboard settings

## Deep Link Redirection

After the purchase flow completes, ZeroSettle automatically redirects users back to your app using your app's bundle ID. Simply use the same bundle identifier, and we'll handle the redirection with either a `success` or `cancelled` status.

### Handling Deep Links

Handle the deep link callback in your app delegate to respond to purchase completion:

```swift
import UIKit

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    
    func application(_ app: UIApplication, 
                    open url: URL, 
                    options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
        
        // Handle ZeroSettle redirect
        if url.scheme == "your-bundle-id" {
            let status = url.lastPathComponent
            
            switch status {
            case "success":
                // Purchase completed successfully
                // Refresh subscription status, show confirmation, etc.
                handlePurchaseSuccess()
                
            case "cancelled":
                // User cancelled the purchase
                // Return to paywall or show appropriate message
                handlePurchaseCancelled()
                
            default:
                break
            }
            
            return true
        }
        
        return false
    }
    
    private func handlePurchaseSuccess() {
        // Refresh RevenueCat customer info
        // Show success message
        // Navigate to appropriate screen
    }
    
    private func handlePurchaseCancelled() {
        // Handle cancellation
        // Return to paywall or previous screen
    }
}
```

For SwiftUI apps, use the `onOpenURL` modifier:

```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct YourApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .onOpenURL { url in
                    if url.scheme == "your-bundle-id" {
                        let status = url.lastPathComponent
                        
                        switch status {
                        case "success":
                            // Handle successful purchase
                            break
                        case "cancelled":
                            // Handle cancellation
                            break
                        default:
                            break
                        }
                    }
                }
        }
    }
}
```

## No Code Changes Required

Unlike traditional integrations, ZeroSettle's RevenueCat integration requires:
- ❌ No Swift SDK installation
- ❌ No code modifications
- ❌ No custom components
- ✅ Just a simple checkout URL

The payment flow, discount application, and subscription management are all handled automatically through the ZeroSettle platform.

## Requirements

- RevenueCat account with paywall configured
- ZeroSettle account with discount settings configured
