## Overview

ZeroSettle provides native support for RevenueCat's paywall infrastructure, enabling developers to integrate payment incentives directly into their existing subscription flows. The integration is designed to be minimally invasive, requiring only a single component addition to your existing `PaywallView` implementation.

## Implementation

The integration architecture leverages SwiftUI's declarative layout system. Simply wrap your existing `PaywallView` component within a `ZStack` and add the `ZSCheckoutButton` component positioned at the bottom:

```swift
import RevenueCat
import ZeroSettle

ZStack() {
    PaywallView()
    ZSCheckoutButton()
}
```

## Technical Details

The `ZSCheckoutButton` component integrates directly with RevenueCat's SDK and ZeroSettle's backend infrastructure to provide the following functionality:

### Automatic Package Detection
The button automatically detects and retrieves the currently selected subscription package from RevenueCat's `PaywallView`, eliminating the need for manual package state management or prop passing.

## Requirements

- RevenueCat SDK 4.0+
- ZeroSettle SDK 1.0+
- iOS 15.0+
