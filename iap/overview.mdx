ZeroSettle In-App Purchase is a web checkout SDK for mobile apps. It processes payments via Stripe instead of Apple's StoreKit or Google Play Billing, with ZeroSettle acting as the Merchant of Record.

The platform handles payments, tax compliance, refunds, receipts, and liability. The SDK supports **Swift**, **Kotlin**, and **Flutter**, with React Native coming soon.

## Fee Comparison

| | Apple/Google IAP | ZeroSettle IAP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Fee** | 30% (15% for small business) | 5% + 50¢ |
| **You keep on a $9.99 sale** | $6.99 | ~$8.99 |
| **Tax handling** | Apple/Google handles | ZeroSettle handles |
| **Compliance** | Your responsibility | ZeroSettle's responsibility |
| **Payouts** | 45+ days | [Instant via Stripe](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login) |
| **Your Stripe account** | N/A | Use your own (BYOS) or ours (Managed) |

With **Bring Your Own Stripe (BYOS)**, you connect your existing Stripe account and keep your products, prices, customers, and reporting. Charges go directly to your account — ZeroSettle adds the Merchant of Record layer on top. BYOS fee is 0.5%.

## Payment Modes

Choose the integration that fits your business:

| | Managed (Default) | BYOS (Bring Your Own Stripe) |
|---|---|---|
| **Stripe account** | Created for you automatically (Express) | You connect your own (Standard) |
| **Products & prices** | Auto-created by ZeroSettle | Your existing Stripe catalog |
| **Revenue reporting** | Via ZeroSettle dashboard | Your Stripe dashboard + ZeroSettle |
| **Customer data** | Managed by ZeroSettle | In your Stripe account |
| **Setup time** | ~2 minutes | ~10 minutes (connect + map products) |
| **Fee** | 5% + 50¢ | 0.5% |

Both modes share the same SDK integration — no code differences. The only setup difference is on the dashboard.

## How It Works

When a user taps "Buy" in your app, ZeroSettle presents a checkout experience powered by Stripe. The user pays with Apple Pay or a card, and your app gets a verified transaction back.

There are three checkout modes, controlled server-side via remote config:

### Embedded Payment Sheet (Recommended)

`checkoutSheet` presents a native-feeling bottom sheet inside your app. It loads a WKWebView with Apple Pay and card entry. The user never leaves your app.

<CodeGroup>

```swift Swift
.checkoutSheet(item: $selectedProduct, userId: user.id) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let transaction):
        print("Purchased: \(transaction.productId)")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

```kotlin Kotlin
val transaction = ZeroSettle.purchase(
    activity = this,
    productId = product.id,
    userId = user.id,
)
println("Purchased: ${transaction.productId}")
```

```tsx React Native
const transaction = await ZeroSettle.purchase(product.id, user.id);
console.log(`Purchased: ${transaction.productId}`);
```

```dart Flutter
final transaction = await ZeroSettle.instance.presentPaymentSheet(
  productId: product.id,
  userId: user.id,
);
print('Purchased: ${transaction.productId}');
```

</CodeGroup>

This is the recommended approach for the best conversion rates.

### In-App Safari

Opens an `SFSafariViewController` within your app. The checkout page loads in a Safari view controller, and the result comes back via universal link.

### External Safari

Opens the checkout URL in the user's default browser. The result returns to your app via universal link. This is the fallback mode.

<Tip>
  The checkout mode is controlled by your remote config on the ZeroSettle dashboard. You can switch modes without an app update.
