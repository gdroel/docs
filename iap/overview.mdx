ZeroSettle In-App Purchase lets your iOS app accept payments via web checkout instead of Apple's StoreKit. You keep **~94%** of every transaction instead of 70%.

We act as the Merchant of Record — we handle payments, tax compliance, refunds, receipts, and liability. You add a few lines of code and start earning more. We support **Swift** and **Flutter**, with React Native coming soon.

## Why?

The math is simple:

| | Apple IAP | ZeroSettle IAP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Fee** | 30% (15% for small business) | 5% + 50¢ |
| **You keep on a $9.99 sale** | $6.99 | ~$8.99 |
| **Tax handling** | Apple handles | We handle |
| **Compliance** | Your responsibility | Our responsibility |
| **Payouts** | 45+ days | [Instant via Stripe](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login) |

## How It Works

When a user taps "Buy" in your app, ZeroSettle presents a checkout experience powered by Stripe. The user pays with Apple Pay or a card, and your app gets a verified transaction back.

There are three checkout modes, controlled server-side via remote config:

### Embedded Payment Sheet (Recommended)

`ZSPaymentSheet` presents a native-feeling bottom sheet inside your app. It loads a WKWebView with Apple Pay and card entry. The user never leaves your app.

```swift
.zsPaymentSheet(isPresented: $showCheckout, product: product, userId: user.id) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let transaction):
        print("Purchased: \(transaction.productId)")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

This is the recommended approach for the best conversion rates.

### In-App Safari

Opens an `SFSafariViewController` within your app. The checkout page loads in a Safari view controller, and the result comes back via universal link.

### External Safari

Opens the checkout URL in the user's default browser. The result returns to your app via universal link. This is the fallback mode.

<Tip>
  The checkout mode is controlled by your remote config on the ZeroSettle dashboard. You can switch modes without an app update.
