ZeroSettle In-App Purchase lets iOS apps accept payments via web checkout, reducing fees from Apple's 30% to just 4.5%. We act as the Merchant of Record, handling payments, tax compliance, and liability.

<Note>
  In-App Purchase is currently in early access. [Request access](mailto:support@zerosettle.io) to get started.

## Why ZeroSettle IAP?

Apple's 30% fee is brutal for most apps. With ZeroSettle IAP, you can:

| | Apple IAP | ZeroSettle IAP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Fee** | 30% (15% for small business) | 4.5%* |
| **Tax Handling** | You figure it out | We handle it |
| **Compliance** | Your responsibility | Our responsibility |
| **Payouts** | 45+ days | Instant |

*\*Standard rate for transactions over \$15. Smaller transactions add \$0.30 flat fee.*

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="User Taps Purchase">
  Your app presents a purchase option. When tapped, ZeroSettle opens a web checkout using `ASWebAuthenticationSession` (Apple's approved method for external purchases).
</Step>

<Step title="User Completes Payment">
  User pays on our hosted checkout page. We support Apple Pay, credit cards, and more.
</Step>

<Step title="User Returns to App">
  After successful payment, user is redirected back to your app via URL scheme with a purchase token.
</Step>

<Step title="You Verify & Deliver">
  Your app verifies the purchase token with our API, then unlocks the purchased content.
</Step>
</Steps>

- Shows required disclosure before leaving app
- US-only geofencing (as required)
- No IAP alternative for digital goods consumed in-app (where prohibited)

<Warning>
  Apple's rules around external purchases are complex and vary by app category and region. We help you navigate compliance, but you should review Apple's current guidelines for your specific use case.
