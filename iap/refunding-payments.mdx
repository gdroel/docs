You can refund a one-time or non-subscription purchase made by a customer, or the most recent payment of a customer's subscription.

Refunding returns the funds to the customer's payment method (it can take a few days for the payment to be returned, depending on the payment method and the customer's bank). When a refund is made, the customer immediately loses access to any entitlements associated with their subscription, or purchased item.

<Note>
**No Refund for Subscriptions with Billing Issues**

For subscriptions where the most recent invoice failed to be collected, you can't refund the payment (since no payment was made). You can still cancel the subscription.

## Refunding in the Dashboard

To refund a payment:

1. Navigate to the customer profile in your ZeroSettle dashboard
2. Locate the subscription in the "Entitlements" card
3. Click on the "..." menu next to the subscription
4. Select "Refund"

The refund will be processed immediately, and the customer's `CustomerInfo` will be updated to reflect the change in entitlement status.
