The [ZeroSettle dashboard](https://dashboard.zerosettle.io) is where you manage everything that doesn't require a code change — products, pricing, checkout behavior, promotions, and migration campaigns. Changes take effect immediately without an app update.

## API Keys

Your dashboard provides two publishable keys:

| Key prefix | Mode | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `zs_pk_test_` | Sandbox | No real charges. Use during development. |
| `zs_pk_live_` | Live | Real payments processed via Stripe. |

Pass your key to the SDK at launch:

```swift
ZeroSettle.shared.configure(.init(
    publishableKey: "zs_pk_live_..."
))
```

The key prefix determines sandbox vs live mode — there is no separate environment setting.

## Products

Create and manage your product catalog from the dashboard. Each product has:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Product ID** | Must match your App Store Connect product identifier (e.g., `com.app.premium_monthly`) |
| **Display name** | Shown to users in the checkout UI |
| **Description** | Product description |
| **Type** | Auto-renewable subscription, non-renewing subscription, consumable, or non-consumable |
| **Web price** | The price charged via web checkout (independent from App Store pricing) |
| **Synced to ASC** | Whether this product also exists in App Store Connect for StoreKit purchases |

Products are fetched by the SDK via `fetchProducts()` and returned as a `ProductCatalog`:

```swift
let catalog = try await ZeroSettle.shared.fetchProducts(userId: user.id)

for product in catalog.products {
    print("\(product.displayName): \(product.webPrice.formatted)")
}
```

### Dual Pricing

Web prices are set independently from App Store prices. This lets you pass Apple's fee savings on to customers (or keep the margin). The SDK provides both prices so you can show a comparison in your paywall:

- `product.webPrice` — the web checkout price you set on the dashboard
- `product.storeKitPrice` — the App Store price (fetched from StoreKit on-device)

## Checkout Configuration

Control how the checkout UI is presented — no code change required. The SDK reads this configuration automatically when you call `fetchProducts()`.

### Checkout Type

Choose one of three checkout modes:

| Mode | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Payment Sheet** | `webview` | Embedded `WKWebView` inside your app. Best conversion rates. |
| **In-App Safari** | `safari_vc` | `SFSafariViewController` within your app. |
| **External Safari** | `safari` | Opens the user's default browser. Requires [universal links](/iap/universal-links). |

### Jurisdiction Overrides

Override the checkout type and enable/disable web checkout per jurisdiction:

| Jurisdiction | Countries |
|---|---|
| **US** | United States |
| **EU** | EU member states |
| **ROW** | Rest of world (default) |

The SDK automatically detects the user's jurisdiction via StoreKit's `Storefront.current` and applies the matching override. If no override is set, the global default is used.

For example, you might use `webview` globally but disable web checkout in the EU:

```swift
// The SDK handles this automatically — no code needed.
// Just configure it on the dashboard.

// In your app, check before showing web checkout UI:
if ZeroSettle.shared.isWebCheckoutEnabled {
    // Show web checkout button
} else {
    // Fall back to StoreKit
}
```

### Enable / Disable

You can disable web checkout entirely (globally or per jurisdiction) from the dashboard. When disabled, `isWebCheckoutEnabled` returns `false` and calling `purchase()` throws `webCheckoutDisabledForJurisdiction`. Use this to gracefully fall back to StoreKit.

## Promotions

Create promotional pricing for any product. The SDK returns active promotions alongside products, so your app can display them automatically.

Each promotion has:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Display name** | Label shown to users (e.g., "Launch Sale") |
| **Type** | `percent_off`, `fixed_amount`, or `free_trial` |
| **Promotional price** | The discounted price during the promotion |
| **Expiration** | Optional expiry date (nil = no expiration) |

Access promotions via the product:

```swift
if let promo = product.promotion {
    print("\(promo.displayName): \(promo.promotionalPrice.formatted)")
}
```

## Migration Campaigns

If your app currently uses StoreKit subscriptions and you want to migrate users to web checkout, the dashboard lets you create a migration campaign.

### How It Works

1. **Enable migration** on the dashboard and configure the campaign
2. **Set the offer** — choose the product and discount percentage
3. **Customize messaging** — set the title and message shown to eligible users
4. The SDK identifies eligible users (those with active StoreKit subscriptions) and returns the campaign data in `ProductCatalog.config.migration`

### Campaign Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Product ID** | The product to offer for migration |
| **Discount %** | Discount off the web price (e.g., 20 for 20% off) |
| **Title** | Prompt heading (e.g., "Save 20% on your subscription") |
| **Message** | Prompt body explaining the offer |

### Using Migration Data

The SDK provides a built-in `ZSMigrateTipView` widget, or you can build your own UI:

```swift
let catalog = try await ZeroSettle.shared.fetchProducts(userId: user.id)

if let migration = catalog.config?.migration {
    // Show migration prompt to eligible users
    print("\(migration.title): \(migration.discountPercent)% off")
}
```

After a successful migration purchase, track the conversion:

```swift
try await ZeroSettle.shared.trackMigrationConversion(userId: user.id)
```

See [StoreKit Integration](/iap/storekit-integration) for the full migration guide.

## Stripe Integration

ZeroSettle supports two payment modes. Choose one during onboarding:

### Managed (Default)

Connect via Stripe Express. ZeroSettle creates and manages Stripe products and prices for you automatically. Payouts go directly to your bank account.

This is the fastest way to get started — no Stripe product setup required.

### Bring Your Own Stripe (BYOS)

Connect your own standard Stripe account via OAuth. Use your existing Stripe products and prices, and retain full access to your Stripe dashboard for reporting, analytics, and customer management.

In BYOS mode, you must map each ZeroSettle product to its corresponding Stripe product and price using the **Stripe Catalog**. Without a mapping, ZeroSettle won't know which Stripe price to charge at checkout.

<Card title="Stripe Catalog" icon="arrows-left-right" href="/iap/stripe-catalog">
  Map your Stripe products and prices to their ZeroSettle counterparts (BYOS only).

<Note>
  You can switch between Managed and BYOS modes at any time from your tenant settings. Existing Stripe Catalog mappings are preserved when switching back.

## What Requires a Code Change?

Most configuration is dashboard-driven. Here's a quick reference:

| Change | Dashboard | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Switch checkout type | Yes | No |
| Change web pricing | Yes | No |
| Create/end promotions | Yes | No |
| Enable/disable web checkout | Yes | No |
| Launch migration campaign | Yes | No |
| Add a new product | Yes | No |
| Add the SDK to your app | No | Yes |
| Choose `isPresented:` vs `item:` API | No | Yes |
| Handle purchase results | No | Yes |
| Set up universal links (Safari flow) | No | Yes |
