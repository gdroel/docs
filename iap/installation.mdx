## Swift (iOS)

Add ZeroSettleKit via Swift Package Manager in Xcode:

**Xcode UI**: File > Add Package Dependencies, then enter:

```
https://github.com/zerosettle/ZeroSettleKit
```

**Or** add it to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/zerosettle/ZeroSettleKit", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Then add `ZeroSettleKit` as a dependency of your target.

<Note>
  Requires **iOS 17.0+**, **Swift 5.9+**, and **Xcode 15.0+**. No third-party dependencies.
</Note>

### Verify Installation

```swift
import ZeroSettleKit

// If this compiles, you're good
print(ZeroSettle.shared)
```

<Tip>
  Make sure "Embed & Sign" is selected for ZeroSettleKit in your target's **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** settings.
</Tip>

## Flutter

Add the ZeroSettle package from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/zerosettle):

```bash
flutter pub add zerosettle
```

**Or** add it to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  zerosettle: ^0.2.0
```

Then run `flutter pub get`.

<Note>
  Requires **Flutter 3.3.0+** and **iOS 17.0+**. The Flutter SDK is a thin wrapper around the native ZeroSettleKit — it uses CocoaPods to pull in the iOS framework automatically.
</Note>

### Verify Installation

```dart
import 'package:zerosettle/zerosettle.dart';

// If this compiles, you're good
final zs = ZeroSettle.instance;
```
