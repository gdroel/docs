ZeroSettle Skill-Based Escrow lets you build competitive games where players stake real money and earn payouts based on their performance. Funds are locked in an on-chain Solana escrow until settlement—neither you nor the player can cheat.

## Why Skill-Based Escrow?

Traditional in-app purchases don't work for competitive gaming:
- Players want to win real money, not virtual currency
- You need provably fair payouts
- Funds must be held securely during gameplay

ZeroSettle Escrow solves this with:
- **On-chain escrow** - Funds locked in a Solana smart contract
- **Embedded wallets** - No seed phrases or wallet apps required
- **Instant settlement** - Payouts in seconds, not days
- **Payout tables** - Flexible discrete or continuous payout curves

## How It Works

```
Player Stakes → Escrow Locked → Player Competes → Result Submitted → Payout Settled
```

1. **Player authenticates** with phone number (OTP via Privy)
2. **Player stakes** their wager (e.g., $1) into the escrow
3. **House stakes** the liability (your game server)
4. **Escrow confirmed** - both sides locked, game begins
5. **Player competes** normally in your app
6. **Result submitted** with final multiplier
7. **Settlement** - player receives payout instantly

## Game Modes

| Mode | Description | Players |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Single Player** | Player vs house. Payout based on performance. | 1 |
| **Duel** | Player vs player. Winner takes pot. | 2 |
| **Tournament** | Multiple players. Prize pool distribution. | N |

## Example Games

- **Wordle-style** - Fewer guesses = higher payout
- **Puzzle games** - Faster completion = higher payout
- **Score-based** - Higher score = higher payout
- **Trivia** - More correct answers = higher payout
