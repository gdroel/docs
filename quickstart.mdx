Get up and running with ZeroSettleKit in minutes. This guide walks you through adding the Swift package to your Xcode project and making your first deposit.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager (Recommended)

Add ZeroSettleKit to your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open your Xcode project">
  Open your iOS app project in Xcode.
</Step>

<Step title="Add package dependency">
  1. Go to **File** → **Add Package Dependencies...**
  2. Enter the package URL:
  
  ```
  https://github.com/zerosettle/zerosettle-ios
  ```
  
  3. Click **Add Package**
</Step>

<Step title="Select target">
  Choose your app target and click **Add Package**
</Step>
</Steps>

### Minimum Requirements

<Info>
  - **iOS 15.0+**
  - **Swift 5.7+**
  - **Xcode 14.0+**
</Info>

## Basic Usage

### 1. Import the Framework

```swift
import ZSKit
```

### 2. Show the Prebuilt Deposit View

The fastest way to start accepting deposits is using the prebuilt `ZSDepositView`:

```swift
import UIKit
import ZSKit

class YourViewController: UIViewController {
    
    func showDepositView() {
        // Your Solana USDC address
        let solanaAddress = SolanaAddress("YOUR_SOLANA_ADDRESS")
        
        let depositView = ZSDepositView(
            walletAddress: solanaAddress,
            onSuccess: { transaction in
                print("Deposit successful!")
                print("Amount: \(transaction.amount)")
                print("Signature: \(transaction.signature)")
            },
            onError: { error in
                print("Deposit failed: \(error)")
            }
        )
        
        present(depositView, animated: true)
    }
}
```

That's it! The view handles:
- Payment method selection (Apple Pay, Phantom, Metamask)
- Amount input
- Transaction submission
- Real-time status updates
- Error handling

### 3. Test the Integration

Build and run your app, then tap the button that shows the deposit view. You'll see:

1. A screen with payment method options
2. Amount input field
3. A deposit button
4. Real-time transaction status

<Tip>
  Start with small test amounts (e.g., 1 USDC) while you're developing to minimize costs.

## Getting Your Solana Address

You need a Solana address to receive USDC deposits. Here's how to get one:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using Phantom Wallet">
    1. Download [Phantom](https://phantom.app) wallet
    2. Create or import a wallet
    3. Tap your wallet name at the top
    4. Tap "Copy Address"
    5. This is your Solana address for USDC deposits
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Solflare">
    1. Download [Solflare](https://solflare.com) wallet
    2. Create a new wallet
    3. Tap "Receive"
    4. Copy your wallet address
    5. This is your Solana address
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Programmatically">
    If you're managing wallets programmatically, use the Solana SDK:
    
    ```swift
    import Solana
    
    let keypair = Keypair.generate()
    let address = keypair.publicKey.base58EncodedString
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  **Store private keys securely!** Never commit private keys to version control or expose them in your app. Only use public addresses (the receiving address) in your client app.
</Warning>

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Module 'ZSKit' not found">
    **Solution:** Make sure you've added the Swift package dependency and selected your app target. Clean and rebuild your project (**Cmd+Shift+K**, then **Cmd+B**).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Invalid Solana address error">
    **Solution:** Solana addresses are base58-encoded strings, typically 32-44 characters. Make sure you're using the public key, not a private key or seed phrase.
    
    Valid format: `7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Phantom/Metamask not opening">
    **Solution:** Test on a physical device, not the simulator. Wallet apps don't work in the iOS Simulator.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Apple Pay not showing">
    **Solution:** 
    - Test on a physical device with an Apple Pay-enabled card
    - Ensure your Apple Developer account has Apple Pay entitlements
    - Add the Apple Pay capability to your app target in Xcode
  </Accordion>
