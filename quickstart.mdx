</Steps>

### Minimum Requirements

<Info>
  - **iOS 15.0+**
  - **Swift 5.7+**
  - **Xcode 14.0+**
</Info>

## Basic Usage

### 1. Import the Framework

```swift
import ZSKit
```

### 2. Show the Prebuilt Deposit View

The fastest way to start accepting deposits is using the prebuilt `ZSDepositView`:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import ZeroSettleKit

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showDeposit = false
    @State private var balance: Int = 0 // Balance in cents
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Balance: $\(Double(balance) / 100.0, specifier: "%.2f")")
            
            Button("Deposit USDC") {
                showDeposit = true
            }
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showDeposit) {
            ZSDepositView(
                walletAddress: "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS",
                onDeposit: { depositedAmountCents in
                    balance += depositedAmountCents
                    showDeposit = false
                }
            )
        }
    }
}
```

That's it! The view handles:
- Payment method selection (Apple Pay, Phantom, MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet)
- Amount input ($1, $2, $3, $5, $10, or custom)
- Transaction submission
- Real-time status updates
- Error handling

### 3. Test the Integration

Build and run your app, then tap the button that shows the deposit view. You'll see:

1. Payment method options (Apple Pay, Phantom, MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet)
2. Preset amount buttons ($1, $2, $3, $5, $10) or custom amount input
3. A deposit button
4. Real-time transaction status

<Tip>
  Start with $1 or $2 deposits while testing to minimize costs. The preset $1 button makes testing quick and easy!

## Getting Your Wallet Address

You need a wallet address to receive USDC deposits. ZeroSettle supports both Solana and Ethereum/Base addresses:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Solana Address (for Phantom)">
    1. Download [Phantom](https://phantom.app) wallet
    2. Create or import a wallet
    3. Tap your wallet name at the top
    4. Tap "Copy Address"
    5. Use this address - it looks like: `7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkhe...`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Ethereum/Base Address (for Apple Pay, MetaMask, Coinbase)">
    1. Download [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) or [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
    2. Create or import a wallet
    3. Copy your wallet address
    4. Use this address - it starts with `0x` like: `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844...`
    
    **Note:** The same Ethereum address works on Base network
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  **Security:** Never store or expose private keys in your app. Only use public wallet addresses. Private keys should be stored securely on the backend or in user-controlled wallets only.
</Warning>

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Module 'ZeroSettleKit' not found">
    **Solution:** Make sure you've added the Swift package dependency and selected your app target. Clean and rebuild your project (**Cmd+Shift+K**, then **Cmd+B**).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Invalid wallet address error">
    **Solution:** Make sure you're using a valid address format:
    - **Solana:** Base58-encoded, 32-44 characters (e.g., `7xKXtg2CW87...`)
    - **Ethereum/Base:** Hex string starting with `0x`, 42 characters (e.g., `0x742d35Cc...`)
    
    Never use private keys or seed phrases—only public addresses!
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Phantom/MetaMask not opening">
    **Solution:** Test on a physical device, not the simulator. Wallet apps don't work in the iOS Simulator. Make sure the wallet app is installed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Apple Pay not showing">
    **Solution:** 
    - Test on a physical device with an Apple Pay-enabled card
    - Ensure your Apple Developer account has Apple Pay entitlements
    - Add the Apple Pay capability to your app target in Xcode
    - Make sure you're in a supported region
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Amounts not updating correctly">
    **Solution:** Remember all amounts are in **cents**, not dollars:
    - 100 cents = $1.00
    - 500 cents = $5.00
    - To display: `"$\(Double(cents) / 100.0, specifier: "%.2f")"`
